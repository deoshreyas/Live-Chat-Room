# Live-Chat-Room

## :zap: About
This is a small project I made to simulate, at the **very basic, barebones level**, a chat room using Python Sockets, and Flask. It is a simple Full-stack application that you can run ona development server to fidget and play with chat rooms!

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
Just clone the repository on your machine, and install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You can use a virtual environment for this. Then just run `main.py` and have fun! 

I have made the project super-intuitive and cool, so you won't need any more instructions. Let me know how I can improve! Also, a fun little thing you'll notice, the colours of the webpages change randomly! I made this to test something, and it became a full-on feature!
